# This is a Shmupmame's lagless drivers porting project！
I have found the "Shmupmame" project hasn't been updated for a very long while,so I ported it into the newest MAME,like "Groovymame" or "Arcade",used the C++17 standard(The old MAME code is written by C)
# WIP：
psikyo's lagless driver in C++   
# License:
The whole project is under the GNU-GPL license(as same as MAME,seemed GPLv2) and the code should be compatible with the 3-Clause-BSD License
