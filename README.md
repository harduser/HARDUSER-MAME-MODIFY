# This is a Shmupmame's lagless drivers porting project！
I have found the "Shmupmame" project hasn't been updated for a very long while,so I Ported it into the newest MAME,like "Groovymame" or "Arcade",used the C++17 standard(The old MAME code is written by C)
# WIP：
psikyo's lagless driver in C++   
# License:
The Whole Project is GNU-GPL Project(as same as MAME,seemed GPLv2) and the code Should be compatible with the 3-Clause-BSD License
